# Graph Algorithms

Some cool graph algorithms implemented in Python, some not cool graph algorithms also implemented in Python.

Just for fun and enrichment - I'm not doing anything that built-in libraries, networkx, or other people haven't done before.

## Some stuff that is here:
- Graph Search
- Topological Sorting (or *special* graph search)
- Max Flow (FF, EK short pipe, EK fat pipe)

## Some stuff that I intend to add:
- MST and MBST algorithms
- Dinics max flow algorithm 
- SSSP/APSP (Prims/Jarnik, Boruvkas, Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra's, Floyd-Warshall)
- Kosaraju Sharir for finding SCC of a graph
